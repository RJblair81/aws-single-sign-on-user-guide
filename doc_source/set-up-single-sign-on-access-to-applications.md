# Step 7: Set up single sign\-on access to your applications \(optional\)<a name="set-up-single-sign-on-access-to-applications"></a>

With IAM Identity Center, you can use AWS applications that are integrated with IAM Identity Center, cloud applications for which AWS provides preintegration, and custom SAML 2\.0 applications\. The configuration steps for setting up single sign\-on access to applications vary based on the application type\. 
+ [Add and configure an Identity Center enabled application](awsapps.md#awsapps-add-config-app)
+ [Add and configure a cloud application](saasapps.md#saasapps-addconfigapp)
+ [Add and configure a custom SAML 2\.0 application](samlapps.md#addconfigcustomapp)

For more information about supported application types, see [Application assignments](manage-your-applications.md)\.

After you follow the guidance in the relevant topics, your users can access your applications from within their AWS access portal based on the permissions that you assigned\.
