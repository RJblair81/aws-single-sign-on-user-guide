# Manage IAM Identity Center certificates<a name="managecerts"></a>

IAM Identity Center uses certificates to set up a SAML trust relationship between IAM Identity Center and your cloud application's service provider\. When you add an application in IAM Identity Center, an IAM Identity Center certificate is automatically created for use with that application during the setup process\. By default, this autogenerated IAM Identity Center certificate is valid for a period of five years\.

As an IAM Identity Center administrator, you'll occasionally need to replace older certificates with newer ones for a given application\. For example, you might need to replace a certificate when the expiration date on the certificate approaches\. The process of replacing an older certificate with a newer one is referred to as *certificate rotation*\.
