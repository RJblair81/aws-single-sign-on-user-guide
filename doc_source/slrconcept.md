# Service\-linked roles<a name="slrconcept"></a>

[Service\-linked roles](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html?icmpid=docs_iam_console#iam-term-service-linked-role) are predefined IAM permissions that allow IAM Identity Center to delegate and enforce which users have single sign\-on access to specific AWS accounts in your organization in AWS Organizations\. The service enables this functionality by provisioning a service\-linked role in every AWS account within its organization\. The service then allows other AWS services like IAM Identity Center to leverage those roles to perform service\-related tasks\. For more information, see [AWS Organizations and service\-linked roles](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html#orgs_integrate_services-using_slrs)\.

When you enable IAM Identity Center, IAM Identity Center creates a service\-linked role in all accounts within the organization in AWS Organizations\. IAM Identity Center also creates the same service\-linked role in every account that is subsequently added to your organization\. This role allows IAM Identity Center to access each account's resources on your behalf\. For more information, see [Multi\-account permissions](manage-your-accounts.md)\. 

Service\-linked roles that are created in each AWS account are named `AWSServiceRoleForSSO`\. For more information, see [Using service\-linked roles for IAM Identity Center](using-service-linked-roles.md)\.
