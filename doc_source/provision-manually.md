# Manual provisioning<a name="provision-manually"></a>

Some IdPs do not have System for Cross\-domain Identity Management \(SCIM\) support or have an incompatible SCIM implementation\. In those cases, you can manually provision users through the IAM Identity Center console\. When you add users to IAM Identity Center, ensure that you set the user name to be identical to the user name that you have in your IdP\. At a minimum, you must have a unique email address and user name\. For more information, see [User name and email address uniqueness](users-groups-provisioning.md#username-email-unique)\.

You must also manage all groups manually in IAM Identity Center\. To do this, you create the groups and add them using the IAM Identity Center console\. These groups do not need to match what exists in your IdP\. For more information, see [Groups](users-groups-provisioning.md#groups-concept)\.
