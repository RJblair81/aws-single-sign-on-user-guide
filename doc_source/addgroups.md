1. Choose **Groups**\.

1. Choose **Create group**\.

1. Enter a **Group name** and **Description \- *optional***\. The description should provide details on what permissions have been or will be assigned to the group\. Under **Add users to group \- *optional***, locate the users you want to add as members\. Then select the check box next to each of them\.

1. Choose **Create group**\.

After you add this group to your Identity Center directory, you can assign single sign\-on access to this group\. For more information, see [Assign user access](useraccess.md#assignusers)\.
