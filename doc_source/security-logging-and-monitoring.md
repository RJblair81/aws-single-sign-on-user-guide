# Logging and monitoring in IAM Identity Center<a name="security-logging-and-monitoring"></a>

As a best practice, you should monitor your organization to ensure that changes are logged\. This helps you to ensure that any unexpected change can be investigated and unwanted changes can be rolled back\. AWS IAM Identity Center \(successor to AWS Single Sign\-On\) currently supports two AWS services that help you monitor your organization and the activity that happens within it\.
