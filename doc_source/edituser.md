1. Open the [IAM Identity Center console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon)\.

1. Choose **Users**\.

1. Choose the user that you want to edit\.

1. On the user **Profile** page, next to **Profile details**, choose **Edit**\.

1. On the **Edit profile details** page, update the properties as needed\. Then, choose **Save changes**\.
**Note**  
\(Optional\) You can modify additional attributes such as **Employee number** and **Office 365 Immutable ID** to help map the user's identity in IAM Identity Center with certain business applications that users need to use\. 
**Note**  
The **Email address** attribute is an editable field and the value you provide must be unique\.
