# SCIM profile and SAML 2\.0 implementation<a name="scim-profile-saml"></a>

Both SCIM and SAML are important considerations for configuring IAM Identity Center\. 

## SAML 2\.0 implementation<a name="samlfederationconcept"></a>

IAM Identity Center supports identity federation with [SAML \(Security Assertion Markup Language\)](https://wiki.oasis-open.org/security) 2\.0\. This allows IAM Identity Center to authenticate identities from external identity providers \(IdPs\)\. SAML 2\.0 is an open standard used for securely exchanging SAML assertions\. SAML 2\.0 passes information about a user between a SAML authority \(called an identity provider or IdP\), and a SAML consumer \(called a service provider or SP\)\. The IAM Identity Center service uses this information to provide federated single sign\-on\. Single sign\-on allows users to access AWS accounts and configured applications based on their existing identity provider credentials \(such as a user name and password\)\. 

IAM Identity Center adds SAML IdP capabilities to your IAM Identity Center store, AWS Managed Microsoft AD, or to an external identity provider\. Users can then single sign\-on into services that support SAML, including the AWS Management Console and third\-party applications such as Microsoft 365, Concur, and Salesforce\. 

The SAML protocol however does not provide a way to query the IdP to learn about users and groups\. Therefore, you must make IAM Identity Center aware of those users and groups by provisioning them into IAM Identity Center\. 

## SCIM profile<a name="scim-profile"></a>

IAM Identity Center provides support for the System for Cross\-domain Identity Management \(SCIM\) v2\.0 standard\. SCIM keeps your IAM Identity Center identities in sync with identities from your IdP\. This includes any provisioning, updates, and deprovisioning of users between your IdP and IAM Identity Center\.

For more information about how to implement SCIM, see [Automatic provisioning](provision-automatically.md)\. For additional details about IAM Identity Centerâ€™s SCIM implementation, see the [IAM Identity Center SCIM Implementation Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/developerguide/what-is-scim.html)\.
