# Authenticator apps<a name="mfa-types-apps"></a>

Authenticator apps are essentially one\-time password \(OTP\)â€“based third party\-authenticators\. Users can use an authenticator application installed on their mobile device or tablet as an authorized MFA device\. The third\-party authenticator application must be compliant with RFC 6238, which is a standards\-based TOTP \(time\-based one\-time password\) algorithm capable of generating six\-digit authentication codes\. 

When prompted for MFA, users must enter a valid code from their authenticator app within the input box presented\. Each MFA device assigned to a user must be unique\. Two authenticator apps can be registered for any given user\.
