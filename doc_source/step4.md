# Set up SSO to your applications<a name="step4"></a>

With AWS SSO, you can use AWS applications that are integrated with AWS SSO, cloud\-applications for which AWS provides preintegration, and custom SAML 2\.0 applications\. Depending on which application type you are trying to set up, review the topics below: 
+ [Add and configure an AWS SSO\-integrated application](awsapps.md#awsapps-add-config-app)
+ [Add and configure a cloud application](saasapps.md#saasapps-addconfigapp)
+ [Add and configure a custom SAML 2\.0 application](samlapps.md#addconfigcustomapp)

For more information about supported application types, see [Manage SSO to your applications](manage-your-applications.md)\.

After you follow the guidance in the topic, you will have successfully configured AWS SSO and set up a trust with your service provider\. Your users can now access these applications from within their user portal based on the permissions you assigned\.
