AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) helps you securely manage identities and access to AWS services and resources\. As an IAM service, AWS IAM Identity Center \(successor to AWS Single Sign\-On\) is where you create, or connect, your *workforce identities* in AWS once and manage access centrally to your multiple AWS accounts and applications\.

For IAM Identity Center customers, there is no change to how you centrally manage access to multiple AWS accounts or applications\. For new customers to IAM Identity Center, you can flexibly configure IAM Identity Center to run alongside or replace single AWS account access management using IAM\.
