IAM Identity Center provides the following set of features that enables admins to control AWS access portal use, to set session durations for users in the AWS access portal and your applications, and to utilize attributes for access control\. These features work with an Identity Center directory or external identity provider as your identity source\. Session management is currently not supported for an Active Directory identity source\.
