# How to customize the user portal URL<a name="howtochangeURL"></a>

By default, your AWS SSO user portal is accessible through a URL of the form `d-xxxxxxxxxx.awsapps.com/start`\. However, you can customize the URL to `your_subdomain.awsapps.com/start`\. This change to the user portal URL is permanent, and you will not be able to edit it later\.

**To customize your URL**

1. Sign in to your user portal\. For more information, see [ How to sign in to the user portal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/singlesignon/latest/userguide/howtosignin.html)\.

1. In the AWS SSO console, under Dashboard, go to the **User portal** section at the bottom of the page\.

1. Choose **Customize**\.

1. Enter your desired domain name and choose **Save**\.

You can now sign in to the AWS Console through your user portal with your customized `awsapps.com/start` URL\.
