# Customizing the AWS access portal URL<a name="howtochangeURL"></a>

By default, your AWS access portal is accessible through a URL of the form `d-xxxxxxxxxx.awsapps.com/start`\. However, you can customize the URL to `your_subdomain.awsapps.com/start`\. This change to the AWS access portal URL is permanent, and you will not be able to edit it later\.

**To customize your URL**

1. Sign in to your AWS access portal\. For more information, see [ How to sign in to the AWS access portal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/singlesignon/latest/userguide/howtosignin.html)\.

1. In the IAM Identity Center console, under Dashboard, go to the **AWS access portal** section at the bottom of the page\.

1. Choose **Customize**\.

1. Enter your desired domain name and choose **Save**\.

You can now sign in to the AWS Console through your AWS access portal with your customized `awsapps.com/start` URL\.
