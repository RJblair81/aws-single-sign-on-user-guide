# Using the AWS access portal<a name="using-the-portal"></a>

Your AWS access portal provides you with single sign\-on access to all your AWS accounts and most commonly used cloud applications such as Office 365, Concur, Salesforce, and many more\. From here you can quickly launch multiple applications simply by choosing the AWS account or application icon in the portal\. The presence of icons in your portal means that an administrator or designated help desk employee from your company has granted you access to those AWS accounts or applications\. It also means that you can access all these accounts or applications from the portal without additional sign\-in prompts\.

Contact your administrator or help desk to request additional access in the following situations:
+ You don't see an AWS account or application that you need access to\.
+ The access that you have to a given account or application is not what you expected\.
